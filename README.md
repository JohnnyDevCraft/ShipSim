# ShipSim

Ahoy there, Captain! Welcome to ShipSim, your riveting shipping simulation solution. Because obviously, you've got nothing better to do than navigate imaginary boats across a digital ocean.

## 1. Overview
ShipSim is a small but mighty application that simulates Space Ship logistics. It demonstrates the power of:
- SOLID Principles (because who doesn't love a meticulously planned architecture?)
- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It... until you do)
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself, especially when it comes to making coffee)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Sailor — sorry, not "stupid" here)
- Leveraging the mediating awesomeness of MediatR for ultimate decoupling

It's designed to scale (some might say "ship out"), all while keeping your codebase neat and tidy.

---

## 2. Features
- Create, track, and manage Star Ships (who doesn't want that, right?)
- Integration with MediatR for crisp request-response handling
- Clean, maintainable structure courtesy of SOLID
- Logging for debugging in full salty space pirate mode (All logs are DEBUG by default with the prefix [Class.Method])

---

## 3. Technology Stack
- .NET (Because, well, C# is the jam)
- MediatR (for that sweet, sweet decoupling)
- Other dependencies you can't live without

---

## 4. Getting Started
1. Clone the repo using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourName/ShipSim.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ShipSim
   ```
3. Install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
4. Build it (because ships need shipbuilders):
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
5. Finally, run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

---

## 5. Usage
- Spin up the API or console app (depending on how fancy you got with those projects).
- Start simulating space battles, building your bridge crew, or whatever else your spaceship heart desires.
- Check out DEBUG logs prefixed by [File.Method] if you really need to know everything that's happening at sea.

## 6. Contributing
If you actually want to dive into this code like a swashbuckling coder:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement your changes (with or without sarcasm, your call)
4. Open a Pull Request
5. Wait for the applause (or at least a code review)

Enjoy your space adventure, Captain. Now get out there and conquer those digital star systems!
